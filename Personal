          <p>I am Nevermore, some dumb 21 year old college student near Portland, Oregon. You may have also seen me<br> around some nerdy corners of the internet as ABoxOfPringles, Quoththeserver404, Win4ce or Pokefrazer.</p>

        <h2>Honestly</h2>
          <p>HTML is hard. I mean, really <em>really</em> hard. It's probably second nature for people <br> once they got the basic shit down, but I'm at drinking age and know jack shit. <br> that's saying tons. I'm really late to programming in general. If you want to know more, <a href=file:///home/nevermore/Dokumentoj/Programs/HTML/Personal/loser.html>Here ya go!</a><br> I'll mostly be using this site to experiment with little things as I learn more about coding in general<br> (<i>Yes, I'm implying HTML is coding in the first place<i>) and as a result it'll likely change<br> in format many times. HTML is the skeleton of a website, after all.</ref><p>
